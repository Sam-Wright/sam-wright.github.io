I received my BS in Mechanical Engineering in 2014, and my MS in Mechanical Engineering with an emphasis in Robotics in 2016 -- both from the University of Utah. 

By day, I design actuators in [next generation robots](http://www.sarcos.com/products/guardian-xo/). The rest of my time is spent on projects ranging from 3d-printing to traditional hand-tool woodworking. 

You can find a copy of my professional resume [here]({{ site.url }}/images/resume/Sam_Wright_Resume.pdf).
