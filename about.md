I received my BS in Mechanical Engineering in 2012, and my MS in Mechanical Engineering with an emphasis in Robotics in 2014 -- both from the University of Utah. 

By day, I design actuators in [next generation robots](http://www.sarcos.com/products/guardian-xo/). The rest of my time is spent on projects ranging from 3d-printing to traditional hand-tool woodworking.
