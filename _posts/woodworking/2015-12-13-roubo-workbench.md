This is my Split-Top Roubo workbench. I made this following along with the Paul Sellers build [see the series here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD39949332C7FB168) :

This is made from jointed and laminated construction grade Douglas Fir lumber. The bench is build using Paul Sellers' modular design which allows the workbench to be easily disassembled to be moved easier. The wood is finished off with a single coat of Watco Danish Oil for some light protection. 

I was a little unsure of the 'tool-well' style workbench at first, but have come to love the concept. If I am honest however, my 'tool-well' acts more as a 'waste-well' which allows me to easily funnel all the waste that would pile up on the top of the bench into a garbage located underneath the bench at one end.
