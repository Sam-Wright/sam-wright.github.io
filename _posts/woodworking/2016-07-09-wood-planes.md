I have long envied the planes made by [Scott Meek Woodworks](http://scottmeekwoodworks.com/). I originally saw the planes from watching Shannon Rogers. Clearly I took my own liberties with the design, but here is a matching Jack Plane and Coffin Smoother.

 The planes are both constructed of Peruvian Walnut sides, Hard Maple bodies and wedge. The pin is made from brass, and epoxied in place. The plane blade is 2" wide and made from 5/32" A2 tool steel. The irons were annealed and setup with a healthy camber, then rehardened and oil quenched. Both beds are just above 45Â°, making them somewhat of high-angle planes. Finishing is a simple Danish Oil with a good waxy buildup on the sole of the planes making them glide across wood.
 
 They perform wonderfully and really excel on knotty and twisted grained woods. The blades were a bit of a science fair project and I wasn't sure how they'd work out, but thankfully they work great and hold their edge for a good long time.
