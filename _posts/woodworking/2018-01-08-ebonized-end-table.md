This is the end-table featured in [The English Woodworker's](https://www.theenglishwoodworker.com/) [Side Table and Bridle Guide](https://www.theenglishwoodworker.com/the-side-table-bridle-guides/) project. The whole table is made from white oak, and the legs are ebonized in the method illustrated in the series. The top and legs are finished with [Minwax Polycrylic Water-Based Polyurethane](http://www.minwax.com/wood-products/clear-protective-finishes/interior/minwax-polycrylic-protective-finish).

The table relies heavily on bridal joints for the leg-apron joint, and a simple half-lap joint at the center apron intersection. All joints are secured with simple hide-glue. The top is quite stout (~1" thick solid oak), and feathers to a 1/4" exposed edge to give it a lighter look.
