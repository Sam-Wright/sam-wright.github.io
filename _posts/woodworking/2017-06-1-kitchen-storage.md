Our new home had some pretty abysmal storage in the kitchen. Having plenty of left-over storage from my previous Kitchen Step Stool build, I decided to build in some sliding drawers. The cabinet hinges had to be replaced with some [Blum 170 deg hinges](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B018A37R68/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1) They utilize full extension soft-close sliders, and naturally employ dovetail joinery to withstand a lifetime+ of of daily wear-and-tear. They are finished with 3 thin coats shellac and withstand moisture and wear wonderfully.
