This is a 36" Roubo Frame Saw I made from the Blackburn tools blade kit (which comes in a gnarly 2 1/3 TPI). The frame itself is constructed from Red Oak, and is modeled similar to Tom Fidgen's design which he outlined in the [Unplugged Woodshop](http://www.tauntonstore.com/the-unplugged-woodshop-071423.php).

The Blackburn blade was purchased with cut teeth, but unsharpened. After carefully sharpening the teeth, I excitedly assembled the saw and was floored with how poorly it cut. After spending some time angrily staring at my large paperweight, it occurred to me that the blade had no set! Realizing my error, I ran to Ebay and purchased a fantastic Stanley 42w pistol-grip saw set. After setting the saw appropriately, the saw cuts like a dream! Because of the extremely coarse teeth, I can hog through material with a great cut quality. It definitely take s some getting used to the new sawing kinematics but with a little practice, I feel pretty confident making long rip cuts and even some basic resawing.
