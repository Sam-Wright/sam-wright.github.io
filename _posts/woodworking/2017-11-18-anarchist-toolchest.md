This is a rather straightforward implementation of [Christopher Shwarz's](https://www.popularwoodworking.com/woodworking-blogs/chris-schwarz-blog/page/3) Anarchist Toolchest, from his book [The Anarchist's Tool Chest](https://lostartpress.com/products/the-anarchists-tool-chest). 

It is built exclusively in pine, and finished with red/black milk paint from [Old Fashioned Milk Paint](http://www.milkpaint.com) and with 5-6 coats of [Watco Danish Oil](https://www.rustoleum.com/product-catalog/consumer-brands/watco/watco/danish-oil/) for durability. 

For construction details, [buy the book!](https://lostartpress.com/products/the-anarchists-tool-chest) Its a great read! Almost definitionally, this is a project that will slowly and continually evolve over time, so we'll see how this looks in a year or two.
