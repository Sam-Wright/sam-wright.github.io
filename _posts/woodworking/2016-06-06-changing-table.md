Here is a changing table I made for my son:

It is made using a combination of Peruvian Walnut, Hard Maple, and Douglas Fir. The frame is made with basic mortise and tenon joinery, using draw-bored tenons. (Although a couple of the draw-bored pins were a little too tight).

The front and rear skirts are secured using sliding dovetails. The upper shelf is supported in the center with a hidden pin located behind the half-lap braces on each side.

The top has a changing pad and some basic storage using a simple through-dovetailed frame. The changing pad frame is friction-pinned in place to secure it to the top, but is easily removable so in the future this will simple double as a regular storage shelf.

The legs have a slight taper towards the bottom to 'lighten' the legs as the whole thing looked a little overly beefy.

Apart from the obvious need for a changing table, it sure seems like I just needed an excuse for practicing each of the different joining methods. I didn't really notice it at the time, but the joining methods were all over the place.
