Here is my take on [this ](http://samuraicarpenter.com/gyokucho-japanese-saw-stand/) saw stand:

![Japanese Saw Stand]({{ site.url }}/images/saw_stand/IMG_20170101_223259.jpg "Japanese Saw Stand")

Made from some surplus Douglas Fir, given a light char to make the grain pop, and finished with some Boiled Linseed Oil for some light protection.

Both joints are wedged through tennons, with some extra reinforcement from some liquid hide glue. The upper through tennon is left long for extra decoration.
