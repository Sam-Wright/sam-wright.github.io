I've seen many platform beds around the internet, and I finally decided to build one!

I jumped onto OnShape to model one up-- and 4 versions later I had my dimesions ready.

Onto the physical world-- I have been looking for an oppertunity to play with a new(to me) exotic. So a quick trip later from the hardwood dealer, and I had $600 worth of African Mahogany. For the headboard I wanted to bring in some contrast, and help tie into much of the existing furnature in the room. For this I went the ebonized Red Oak route, and it works great on both fronts.

Here it is --

The main portions of the bedframe are assembeld with dowels for alignment and assembled cantilevered stiffness, and lag-bolts to allow for dissassembly. The bed-slats are sourced from [ikea](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/00160215/). 

The headboard is assembeld with lap joints and houses a floating oak pannel. It attaches to the bedframe base with a simple piano hinge allowing it to swing up to acces chargers and other wiring that gets housed behind it.

The entire project is finished with a coat of Danish Oil, and topped with a few coats of matte finish water-based polyurethane (which is knocked down further with a light pass with red Scotch-Brite).
