This project is my implementation of the [Wood Whisperer's Kitchen Step Stool](https://www.thewoodwhisperer.com/videos/kids-kitchen-step-stool/). The design utilizes an adjustable height for the growing little-one, and knock-down joinery (which came in handy in our recent home purchase).

It is pretty much a direct copy of the Wood Whisperer using the recommended cherry, finished with a combination of boiled linseed oil, and 2 layers of shellac. So far it has held up great to the harsh usage of a messy 2 year-old. 

(Pictures are taken nearly a year into daily use)
