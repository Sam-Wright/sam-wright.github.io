This is the first public release to my _Coinbase Tracker_ utility. It is written in python3 and monitors the 3 currencies that are traded at [coinbase.com](coinbase.com) for automated cryptocurrency speculation. Modest returns have been rather trivial surprisingly and it would be great to get broader community input into algorithms and buy/sell criteria.

I likely won't be updating with the minute details here, but progress can be tracked at the [Coinbase Tracker Project](https://github.com/sam-wright/coinbase_tracker)
