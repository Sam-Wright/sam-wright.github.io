Not a whole lot of details to post, but the new home is employing [Home-Assistant](https://home-assistant.io) for basic home automation. I have long term visions of unifying the Home Assistant system with the existing Vivint system. Current home automation includes:
- Belkin Wemo Smart Switches
- Netgear Device Tracking
- Z-Wave Smart Switches
- Telegram Notifications
- AQI and Darksky Monitoring
- Zoneminder Automation (webcam monitoring)
- Rachio (Smart Sprinklers)
- Ecobee4 Integration (Thermostat and Occupancy Monitoring)
- Kodi and Chromecast Integrations
- Pihole Monitoring
- Commute Monitoring
- A really cool customizable floorplan view

I likely won't be updating with the minute details here, but progress can be tracked at [My Home Assistant Config](https://github.com/sam-wright/Home-AssistantConfig)
